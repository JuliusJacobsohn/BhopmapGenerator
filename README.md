# BhopmapGenerator
A simple abstraction over Hammer's VMF Model that let's you "program" maps.

Inside the Model folder are the "low level" models, if you want to write code please use the models in the "Structures" folder, such as Cuboid (simple Cube), Room (Simple room with 6 Cuboids), ...

Planned features:
Structures for Spawnzones, Bhopzones and much more
Simple Roomconnector that creates a portal at the end of one and a teleport destination at the start of the other
Support for entities such as light
The actual mapgenerator (Select length, difficulty, standard textures and get a full map with spawn and end)
